# Meet the team React App
## Overview
This project is a dynamic web application built with React, designed to showcase team members of a tech startup. It utilizes React components to display profiles of team members, including their names, roles, and photos dynamically.

## Features
- **Component-Based Structure:** Utilizes separate components (Gallery, Profile, Header) to modularize the application and promote reusability.

- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Team member profiles are rendered dynamically using data passed as props, allowing easy updates and additions to the team.

- **Styling:** Custom CSS styles (App.css) enhance the presentation with centered text, styled headers, and responsive gallery layout.
